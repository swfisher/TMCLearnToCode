(Ordered by priority)

2. Attempt any previous homework assignments that were left unfinished. 
3. Attempt any of the Free Code Camp [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting) challenges that you've not yet solved.
