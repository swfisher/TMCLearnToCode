1. Complete the problems at the end of [eloquent javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) chapters 2,3, and 4. When you finish all the problems for a chapter, put your answers in either a single .js file or a .zip file and slack them to Sam. Sam will get you individual feedback on the answers. Feel free to reach out for feedback in the group channel as well.
2. If you have finished the above, let's chat about how you'd like to continue. You can continue through eloquent javascript, start a personal development project, or both.
